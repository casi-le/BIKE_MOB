                    <p>Fort Collins is our home and we love it here.</p> 
                    <p>That said, we can be so much more! Bikes are an amazing tool and heaps of fun, but beyond that, they’re so popular with us because they’re a means to a richer and more meaningful community experience.</p> <p>When the automobile got lobbied into the mainstream our cities and neighborhoods became spread out and the “great alienation” began, with the only means of transportation being the car. You can live out your entire existence traveling from your house-bubble, to your work-bubble via your car-bubble and never connect with the beautiful people around you.</p> <p>While there are many ways to tackle this issue, we are choosing to show up to the conversation via bicycle. We also support public transportation, mixed commercial-residential zoning laws, high density housing and a walkable/rideable city.</p></div>
